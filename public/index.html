In a former life, I was involved in competitive debate. In high school, I was ranked as one the world&#39;s top ten speakers (World Schools Debating Championships) and was thereafter a coach for Team Malaysia 2022. 

Apart from economics and development, I have a deep interest in foreign policy, effective altruism, evolutionary biology, and apologetics. Through this site, I hope to better reflect on what I experience and learn!">
