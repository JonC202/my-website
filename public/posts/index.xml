      <description>Rolling correlations are correlations between two time series data sets using a rolling window. Unlike ordinary correlation analyses, they offer the advantage of visualising the relationship between variables across multiple consecutive time periods. In the graph below, quarterly prices of Spot WTI and Brent crude oil prices are used to produce four-quarter rolling correlations across the period from 2Q1999 to 3Q2022: each point represents a four-quarter correlation between the price of WTI and Brent.</description>

      <description>This post hopes to provide a brief overview of post-1949 US-China relations. While I do think/hope much of the analysis presented is accurate and nuanced, do note that many ideas and key events (e.g., 1989 Tiananmen) are left out. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen what to include based on a personal judgement of how significant and interesting ideas or events are in understanding the relationship!
US-China relations occupy a distinct and significant position in modern international relations.</description>

      <description>The motivation for this two-part write-up originated in competitive debate, where ICC-Africa relations were a frequent topic of discussion. An international relations seminar course I took in first year gave me the opportunity to write a policy brief on the issue, from which this write-up is inspired. In Part 1, I dive into the history of the relationship between the ICC and Africa to set a context to a discussion on the present and future in Part 2.</description>
