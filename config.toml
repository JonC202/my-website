description = """I'm  Jonathan, an incoming junior at the University of Toronto specialising in Economics and Data Analytics. I care about macroeconomics, investment finance and nation-building. I was previously a Summer Analyst at J.P. Morgan in equity research and the Malaysian central bank conducting macroeconomic research.

In a former life, I was involved in competitive debate. In high school, I was ranked as one of the world's top ten speakers (World Schools Debating Championships) and was thereafter a coach for Team Malaysia 2022. 

I also have a deep interest in foreign policy, altruism, oncology, evolutionary biology, and apologetics. Through this site, I hope to better reflect on what I experience and learn!"""
