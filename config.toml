description = """I'm  Jonathan, a sophomore at the University of Toronto specialising in Economics and Data Analytics. I care about macroeconomics, development finance and nation-building. I'll be joining J.P. Morgan as a Summer Analyst (Equity Research) in June 2023, and was previously a Summer Analyst at the Malaysian central bank conducting investments and commodities research within the Economics department.

In a former life, I was involved in competitive debate. In high school, I ranked as one the world's top ten speakers (World Schools Debating Championships) and was thereafter a coach for Team Malaysia 2022. 

Apart from economics and development, I have a deep interest in foreign policy, effective altruism, evolutionary biology, and apologetics. Through this site, I hope to better reflect on that which I experience and learn!"""
