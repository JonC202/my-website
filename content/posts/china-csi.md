In the winter semester, I had the opportunity to carry out an independent research project as part of my big data economics course. The paper examines the relationship between COVID-19  cases and deaths in China, and the CSI300 (the Chinese equivalent of the S&P500).

**Abstract**: COVID-19 has induced dramatic political, social and economic turmoil on economies worldwide. Assessing its impact on economic activity has thus become of keen interest to researchers. In particular, China has seen remarkable volatility in dealing with COVID-19, from the “Zero-COVID” policy to its subsequent reversal after the “White Paper Protests”. To this end, this study explores how movements in COVID-19 cases and deaths in China affect the CSI300 stock market index. The study finds that overall, a doubling in COVID-19 in China is associated with a significant decrease of about 106 CNY in the CSI300, after controlling for COVID deaths and the inflation rate. The negative relationship between COVID predictors and the CSI300 is found to have weakened over time, both nationally and at a provincial level. Further, we find that log cases and the inflation rate Granger-cause the CSI300 while log deaths do not. Finally, we conclude by further exploring the data through machine learning techniques.
